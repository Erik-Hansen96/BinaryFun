# YouTube Data Archive

The YouTube Data Archive project is a C++ application using OpenCV to convert any file into binary data, visually represent it as black and white pixel videos. With this, you can store any file you want on YouTube! (or anywhere else you can store videos for free)

## Features

- **Encoding Files:**
  - Converts files into binary data.
  - Represents binary data as a black and white pixel video.
  - Upload to YouTube for free storage.

- **Decoding Videos:**
  - Converts pixel videos back into binary data.
  - Binary data then converts back into original file!

## Usage

1. **Encoding:**
   - Run the program and choose the file you want to encode.
   - Select the encoding option (0).
   - The program will generate a video file and store it as the outputVideo.avi file.

2. **Storage:**
   - Store the output video anywhere you'd like.
   - You can store as many files as you want on YouTube for free.
     
3. **Decoding:**
