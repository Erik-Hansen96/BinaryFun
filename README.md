### The plan is to:
+ take a file and turn it into binary                                                                    ✅
+ use opencv to store that binary in an image using black and white pixels to represent 1's and 0's      ✅
+ turn that into a video                                                                                 ✅
+ upload it to youtube                                                                                   ...
+ download and decode when needed                                                                        ✅

bam - you now have unlimited cloud storage

-Everything works, but haven't tested actually uploading the video from youtube and downloading
